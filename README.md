This is  a file automator i made for university. While working on computers at university, any downloaded files would download to the computer instead of downloading to the cloud drive. This programs scans for any activity in the download folder of any computer and then move the 
file to a given location depending on what type of file is downloaded and what the path of the file contains. For example in my data structures and algorithms module, all PDFs start with DSA2024, so if a file conations that it is then moves to a dsa folder which is on the cloud 
drive.
